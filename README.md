I am interesting in programming but I am a beginner. I want to develop my programming skills through github.
I am particularly interested in Python programs. 
The purpose of learning Python programs is to implement my stock trading system.
I think it is a long and difficult journey, but I want to develop myself by overcoming it through github.
